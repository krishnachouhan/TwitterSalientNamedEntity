# TwitterSalientNamedEntity

A named entity is a term or phrase that identifies an object from a set of other objects with similar attributes.

In data mining, a named entity is a phrase that clearly identifies one item from a set of other items that have similar attributes. 

Examples of named entities are first and last names, geographic locations, ages, addresses, phone numbers, companies and addresses. Named entities are often mined for marketing initiatives. 

This project involves identification of Named entities in tweets and fetching Salient named entity among them

Unlike   carefully   authored   news   text   and   other   longer   content,   tweets   pose   a   number   of  
new   challenges,   due   to   their   short,   noisy,   context­dependent,   and   dynamic   nature.   We   propose   a  
solution   to   the   problem   of   determining   what   a   tweet   is   about   through   semantic   linking:   we   add  
semantics   to   tweets   by   automatically   identifying   concepts   that   are   semantically   related   to   it   and  
conduct   an   empirical   analysis   of   named   entity   recognition   and   disambiguation.   The   identified  
concepts   can   subsequently   be   used   for,   e.g.,   social   media   mining,   thereby   reducing   the   need   for  
manual inspection and selection.
